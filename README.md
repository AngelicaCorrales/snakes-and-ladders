# snakes-and-ladders

## About the project🚀
This program is about the well-known game called "Snakes and Ladders", which consists of a grid in which a certain number of snakes, ladders and players are placed. In order for a player to advance, he must roll a die, so he gets a number from 1 to 6 that determines the number of squares he/she must advance. If a ladder is encountered, the player climbs up the ladder to the square where it ends. If a snake is encountered, the player must go down to the square where the snake ends. The winner of the game will be the first player to reach the last square of the grid, who will be added to the leaderboard, which is ordered from the highest to the lowest score (obtained from the moves and the size of the grid entered) of each player.
